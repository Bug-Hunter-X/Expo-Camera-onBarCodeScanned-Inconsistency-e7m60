# Expo Camera onBarCodeScanned Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the Expo Camera API's `onBarCodeScanned` function. The function intermittently fails to trigger, even when barcodes are clearly visible in the camera's preview.  This is a critical issue for barcode scanning applications built with Expo.

## Bug Description
The `onBarCodeScanned` callback within the Expo Camera component shows unreliable behavior.  It frequently misses barcode scans, leading to an application that fails to perform its core functionality.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or EAS Build.
4. Point the camera at a barcode. Observe that the barcode is not always detected, even when clearly in view and correctly formatted.

## Solution
The solution provided addresses the inconsistent barcode scanning by adding more robust error handling and potentially improving the detection reliability.  The exact cause is likely related to a combination of barcode characteristics (lighting, quality, angle) and the internal workings of the underlying barcode scanning library.
